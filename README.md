# Kalvium PROJECT BUILDER | REACT - QUIZ STAGE I - UI

## Learning Goals

In this exercise, the goal is to learn building a complete quiz app on a stage by stage basis:

- when and how to setup react in your application,
- how to create multiple compoents and design it.

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will try to work with component and css. 

create a new react app using the following command
```
npm create vite@latest quiz
```
Then choose **React** and **javascript**.

```
cd quiz
```

Now go to your App.jsx and remove the unnecessary code. Your app.jsx should be looking similar to the this.
```
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
 
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your task is to create three components
**- HomeComponent**
**- QuizComponent**
**- ResultComponent**

**Note: use rcc to generate the code template. Please keep everything as a static output on the stage - 1. We will make it dynamic over the course**.  

So let's get started!
Check below to see the overall output: You will be trying to replicate this
